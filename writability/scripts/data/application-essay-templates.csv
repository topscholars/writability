We do not offer interviews as part of the application process at Amherst. However, your essays provide you with an opportunity to speak to us.

Remember that your essay should be personal in nature and not simply an argumentative essay.""Rigorous reasoning is crucial in mathematics, and insight plays an important secondary role these days. In the natural sciences, I would say that the order of these two virtues is reversed. Rigor is, of course, very important. But the most important value is insight--insight into the workings of the world. It may be because there is another guarantor of correctness in the sciences, namely, the empirical evidence from observation and experiments.""  -Kannan Jagannathan, Professor of Physics, Amherst College"
Amherst,,300, Inspiration-Art; Future-World Vision ,"""Literature is the best way to overcome death. My father, as I said, is an actor. He's the happiest man on earth when he's performing, but when the show is over, he's sad and troubled. I wish he could live in the eternal present, because in the theater everything remains in memories and photographs. Literature, on the other hand, allows you to live in the present and to remain in the pantheon of the future.  Literature is a way to say, I was here, this is what I thought, this is what I perceived. This is my signature, this is my name.""  - Ilan Stavans, Professor of Spanish, Amherst College, From ""The Writer in Exile: an interview with Ilan Stavans"" by Saideh Pakravan for the fall 1993 issue of The Literary Review"
